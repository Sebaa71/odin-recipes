        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>An empanada is a type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry and filling, common in Spanish, other Southern European, Latin American, and Iberian-influenced cultures around the world. The name comes from the Spanish empanar (to bread, i.e., to coat with bread), and translates as 'breaded', that is, wrapped or coated in bread. They are made by folding dough over a filling, which may consist of meat, cheese, tomato, corn, or other ingredients, and then cooking the resulting turnover, either by baking or frying.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup fruit preserves</li>
                <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>DAY BEFORE: Cream butter and cream cheese together until smoothly blended. Beat in the flour. Shape dough into a smooth ball, wrap in foil or cling wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to a week.</li>
