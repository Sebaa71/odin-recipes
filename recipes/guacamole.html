        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Guacamole; informally shortened to guac in the United States since the 1980s is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. In addition to its use in modern Mexican cuisine, it has become part of international cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avocados:</strong> Of course, you'll need avocados!</li>
                <li><strong>Lime:</strong> Lime juice adds brightness and slows down the browning process.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A teaspoon of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> You'll also need an onion and roma tomatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Herbs and spices:</strong> Fresh cilantro, minced garlic, and cayenne pepper add tons of flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by rinsing the rice to remove excess starch. Rinse in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of water for every 1 cup of rice to the inner pot. Add salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Close the lid and lock. Switch the steam valve to the sealing position.</li>
                <li>Using the "manual" button, cook on high pressure for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the timer is up, allow the pressure to naturally release.</li>
                <li>Once the float valve has dropped (meaning all the pressure has been released), remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork or paddle.</li>
            </ol>
