        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly O. glaberrima (African rice). The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Rice</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by rinsing the rice to remove excess starch. Rinse in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of water for every 1 cup of rice to the inner pot. Add salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Close the lid and lock. Switch the steam valve to the sealing position.</li>
                <li>Using the "manual" button, cook on high pressure for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the timer is up, allow the pressure to naturally release.</li>
                <li>Once the float valve has dropped (meaning all the pressure has been released), remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork or paddle.</li>
            </ol>
